========== The 8-th segment of the split (508 words) ==========


the wok is off the heat  The oil temperature at 180 degrees is only 60% hot

spring sprouts in the oil pan is that they are first cooked to the bottom  Then

they rise quickly  The process of the spring sprouts rises about 1 minute  The

rise of the spring sprouts is too fast to indicate that the oil temperature is

too high and easy to fry  The rise of the spring sprouts is too slow to indicate

that the oil temperature is too low
